                <summary>Symplectic Aspects of Hyperplane Arrangements</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Complexiﬁed complement of hyperplane arrangements are one of the most classical examples of study in singularity theory and algebraic geometry, while its symplectic properties are largely under exploration. In this talk, I’ll present our recent progress toward understanding symplectic geometry of hyperplane arrangements, which is connected to torus-equivariant topology of toric hyperKahler varieties. This is based on the recent joint work with Sukjoo Lee, Yin Li and Cheuk Yu Mak and work in preparation with Sheel Ganatra, Wenyuan Li and Peng Zhou.</p>

                <summary>Segre classes and Lorentzian/covolume polynomials</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Lorentzian polynomials provide a natural generalization of log-concave
                    sequences and have had striking applications to deep conjectures in combinatorics,
                    in work of June Huh and others. We will define a class of closely related polynomials,
                    `covolume polynomials’, and explore situations in intersection theory in which they occur
                    naturally, specifically, their appearance in the context of Segre classes of subschemes of
                    products of projective spaces. We will also describe an application of these considerations
                    to the combinatorics of convex polyhedral cones. </p>

                <p><b>Abstract. </b>The tautological ring of the moduli space of abelian varieties was introduced and computed by van der Geer in the 1990s. I will explain recent progress regarding the existence of non tautological classes on the moduli space of abelian 6-folds. This is based on joint work with Samir Canning and Rahul Pandharipande.

                <summary>CY3 Wall-Crossing using Virtual Classes</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Wall-crossing in enumerative geometry allows us to vary the counting problem and compare the resulting generating series with the original one. It has emerged as a powerful tool for computations and in the study of properties of generating series. In this talk, I will introduce wall-crossing based on some interesting applications and present some new developments, which allow wall-crossing in a more general context using localization of virtual classes. This is based on joint work with Nick Kuhn and Henry Liu.</p>

                <summary>A hyperbolicity conjecture for adjoint bundles</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>A complex manifold X is said to be Brody hyperbolic if it admits no entire curves, which are non-constant holomorphic maps from the complex numbers. When X is a smooth complex projective variety, Demailly introduced an algebraic analogue of this property known as algebraic hyperbolicity. We propose a conjecture on the algebraic hyperbolicity of generic sections of adjoint bundles on X, motivated by Fujita’s freeness conjecture and recent results by Bangere and Lacini on syzygies of adjoint bundles. We present some old and new evidence supporting this conjecture, including when X is any smooth projective toric variety or Gorenstein toric threefold. This is based on joint work with Joaquín Moraga.</p>

                <summary>Remodeling Conjecture with descendants</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>The Remodeling Conjecture of Bouchard-Klemm-Mariño-Pasquetti obtains all-genus open-closed Gromov-Witten invariants of a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold from Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion on the mirror curve. In this talk, I will discuss an extension of this framework to descendant mirror symmetry, that is, the all-genus descendant Gromov-Witten invariants can be obtained from the Laplace transform of topological recursion invariants. The result is based on a correspondence between equivariant line bundles supported on toric subvarieties and relative homology cycles on the mirror curve, which provides an identification of integral structures. I will also discuss an application to Hosono’s conjecture if time permits. This talk is based on joint work in progress with Bohan Fang, Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu, and Zhengyu Zong.

                <summary>Polarized endomorphism of log Calabi-Yau pairs</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>An endomorphism on a normal projective variety X is said to be polarized if the pullback of an ample divisor A is linearly equivalent to qA, for some integer q>1. Examples of these endomorphisms are naturally found in toric varieties and abelian varieties. Indeed, it is conjectured that if X admits a polarized endomorphism, then X is a finite quotient of a toric fibration over an abelian variety. In this talk, we will restrict to the case of log Calabi-Yau pairs (X,B). We prove that if (X,B) admits a polarized endomorphism that preserves the boundary structure, then (X,B) is a finite quotient of a toric log Calabi-Yau fibration over an abelian variety. This is joint work with Joaquin Moraga and Wern Yeong.</p>
